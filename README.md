## Autonomous Mobile Fruit Picking Robot ##
This project is an autonomous mobile manipulator designed specifically for fruit picking in agricultural environments. It integrates advanced vision-based navigation, real-time object detection, and adaptive gripping technology to identify, locate, and harvest fruits with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Overview ##
Autonomous navigation: The robot uses V-SLAM to navigate through orchards or farms, avoiding obstacles while following optimal paths for fruit harvesting.
Real-time object detection: Implements a novel Multiple-Expert Colour Feature Extreme Learning Machine (MEC-ELM) for fast and precise detection of fruits on trees.
Adaptive gripping mechanism: Features an end-effector that adapts to different fruit shapes and sizes, minimizing damage during picking.
Embedded systems and AI integration: Combines edge computing capabilities using Jetson Orin Nano with AI algorithms for on-site processing.

## Current Status ##
The perception and manipulator control software development is in development.
